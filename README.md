Structural Mapping and Digital Twin System 🏗️

This repository documents the project developed at POLI - USP.
The goal was to design a digital twin of a robotic arm capable of mapping physical structures in real time.
The system integrates FPGA, Arduino, and a Processing interface for interactive visualization.
A distance sensor collects spatial data, used to reconstruct the mapped environment digitally.
Motor angles and calibration are controlled via keyboard inputs for precise positioning.
The interface displays both the arm’s movement and its digital counterpart.
This project highlights hardware-software integration and real-time 3D mapping.
See the manual-usuario-final.docx for detailed setup and usage instructions.
